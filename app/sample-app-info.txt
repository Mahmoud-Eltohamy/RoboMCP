This directory is for storing Android and iOS app files (.apk and .app) for testing with Appium.

To use a custom app with the Docker setup:

1. Place your .apk or .app file in this directory
2. Set the environment variable in .env.docker:
   - For Android: ANDROID_APP_PATH=/app/your-app.apk
   - For iOS: IOS_APP_PATH=/app/your-app.app

Note: If no app is specified, the examples will use the Android Settings app or 
an iOS app path that doesn't exist, which will cause an error for iOS.

Sample Apps for Testing:
- For Android: You can download sample apps from https://github.com/appium/android-apidemos
- For iOS: You can download sample apps from https://github.com/appium/ios-test-app
